# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using a dataset that includes various factors such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other demographics. The aim of the project is to identify the factors that most strongly influence loan eligibility and build a model that can accurately predict whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or not. The project includes data exploration and visualization, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and logistic regression. The results of the analysis will be interpreted and communicated effectively to stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to provide insights that can help improve the loan approval process and increase the number of successful loan applications.
